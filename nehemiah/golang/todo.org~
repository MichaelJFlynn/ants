** Strategies
*** Util algorithms
**** TODO Improved Queue
     Implement a queue that has an O(1) time operator to check whether
     an element is in the queue. This is for the breadth first search
**** TODO BFS
     I'm not sure whether I should store paths in the map structure
     or if I should just recalculate bfs every time.
     At the moment, I'm calculating BFS and only returning the very next 
     step any item needs to take to get to the destination. 
**** TODO A*
*** TODO setting areas
    I wanted to use feature detection to determine chokepoints, 
    but it seems as if this approach might have too many pitfalls
    Right now I'm examining xathis' approach. 
    Xathis runs a bfs from every ant on the map

*** TODO managing even distribution of ants
    I'm going to copy xathis and give each cell an increasing explore
    score. The score incrementally increases until an ant brings it back 
    into it's vision.

*** TODO calculating step distance
    I want to have a way to calculate the step distance for any 
    given cell to another cell. I'd also like to store this somehow.
    This could be really expensive in terms of memory, but it will cut 
    down on later game runtime considerably. 
    If I can find a clever algorithm, even better. 

*** storing shortest paths efficiently
    for each valid tile (not water) keep a map of the surrounding tiles.
    I'm going to start with just 2 tiles in any direction for now. 
    This map will store values of which direction to go to from the
    current tile to get the destination tile in the shortest
    number of steps
    

    



** <2013-12-05 Thu>
   I need to write unit tests for the structures in util.go
** <2013-12-03 Tue>
   At this point, I need to do the following
   - finish implementing BFS
   - give it depth limit
     - return error in that case
   - check that types are globally accessible
     - specifically LocDir defined in map.go
   - implement the simple spread apart algorithm as a new bot
