#Ants AI Project

## Introduction
AI Project that I did with Nehemiah Perimore (www.github.com/nehemiahap). We both created Ants AI's (for Google's Ants competition: http://ants.aichallenge.org/). I've created several versions, to two of them against each other, first clone this repo and run:

`cd <path-to-repo>/Mike`

`./v2vsv3.sh`

Currently this will only run on Mac or Linux. The source code I used is in Mike/MikeBot.py
